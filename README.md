# About

Simple gnuplot script to plot latitude-longitude coordinates on a World map. The attached World map (`world-50m.txt`) is at 1:50m resolution. 

Includes 2 variables rather than just static points on the geo-locations
* A color-based z-axis to show counts in each location.
* The circle radius as the second variable.

# Acknowledgements

The script is based on a blog post by Brighten Godfrey [[1]] on how to generate attractive scientific plots using gnuplot.
